# dts2hx_aliases

I've found that sometimes, when using `dts2hx`, some types aren't properly translated from JS/TS to Haxe.

This package contains aliases that route the improperly translated types to their properly typed ones.

Just add this library to your hxml, and it should fix all of the type errors you get from using `dts2hx` packages.
